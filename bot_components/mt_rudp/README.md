# mt_rudp

A Rust library for the [Minetest](http://minetest.net) RUDP protocol.

This project is inspired by the equivalent [Go library](https://github.com/anon55555/mt/tree/master/rudp) by anon5 and uses it as reference implementation.

This library is the first piece in a ecosystem of Rust libraries for building servers, clients and proxies for Minetest.

## TODO

- implement server
- implement reliable window
- documentation
