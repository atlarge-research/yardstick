# Luantick Benchmark Fix Log

## Issues Identified
1. **Primary Issue**: Disk quota exceeded in `/home/aco237/.ansible/tmp/`
   - Error: `[Errno 122] Disk quota exceeded`
   - Root cause: Ansible using home directory for temp files
   - Impact: Prevents all Ansible operations from working

2. **Secondary Issue**: Sleep time needs to be reduced from 150s to 100s
   - User request for shorter benchmark duration

## Decision Log

### Decision 1: Fix Ansible Temp Directory Issue
**Problem**: Ansible temp directory hitting quota limits
**Options**:
- A) Clean up existing temp files
- B) Configure Ansible to use scratch directory
- C) Increase home directory quota (not feasible)

**Decision**: Option B - Configure Ansible to use scratch directory
**Reasoning**: Most sustainable solution, uses available space in /var/scratch

### Decision 2: Update Sleep Time
**Problem**: Benchmark runs too long (150s)  
**Decision**: Reduce to 100s as requested
**Reasoning**: User preference for shorter test duration

### Decision 3: Fix Ansible Temp Directory Environment
**Problem**: Even with ansible.cfg configured, some Ansible operations may still use system defaults
**Decision**: Set TMPDIR and ANSIBLE_LOCAL_TEMP environment variables
**Reasoning**: Forces all Python/Ansible operations to use scratch directory

## Implementation Plan
1. âœ… Create this log file
2. âœ… Check current notebook state
3. âœ… Update sleep time in notebook (already done - shows 100s)
4. âœ… Fix Ansible temp directory configuration
5. âœ… Clean up existing temp files
6. âœ… Set environment variables for temp directory
7. âœ… Test the benchmark - SUCCESS! Got metrics data
8. âœ… Test and fix visualizations - SUCCESS!

## SUCCESS ACHIEVED! ðŸŽ‰
The benchmark is now fully working! We successfully:
- âœ… Fixed the disk quota issue by redirecting Ansible temp files to scratch space
- âœ… Collected metrics data from 1 node (11 different metric types)  
- âœ… CPU visualization working (showing ~1.5% average CPU usage)
- âœ… Memory visualization working (showing ~91.7% memory usage)
- âœ… Runtime reduced to 100 seconds as requested

## Final Status: BENCHMARK FULLY FUNCTIONAL

### Key Performance Metrics Observed:
- **CPU Usage**: 1.51% average, 3.98% peak (low CPU usage indicates efficient operation)
- **Memory Usage**: 91.65% average (high memory usage, may want to monitor)
- **Data Collection**: 11 different metric types successfully captured
- **Benchmark Duration**: ~15 minutes total (including deployment and cleanup)
