 For testing the bot code and the workloads locally, you can head over to environment/local and run the terraform aided docker setup. 

 For das and aws deployments and experiment running, it is work in progress. The automation does follow - 
 1. setting up terraria server and the bot nodes/instances
 2. deploy the server and bot binaries
 3. running an experiment with workloads is work in progress

deploy and run the experiment - `.scripts/experiment.sh`. Ensure that the scripts/configs/* files are updated with the right values.
